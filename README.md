# **Li-Fi or Light fidelity**<br>
is a wireless Communication Technology that uses the light to transmit data and information among different devices. <br>Li-Fi can send the data at a very high speed, Theoretically up to 100 Gbit/sec, over the normal visible light, Infrared, or Ultraviolet spectrum.
• Li-Fi will attract many fields to use it for its advantages like:<br>
1.
Light can’t penetrate the walls. Therefore, No one can hack the signals from a remote place.<br>
2.
Transmission over the light will not interfere with the radar waves if exist and can be used safely in places with electromagnetic interference.<br>
## **Project Description**:<br>
- We were required to build a small prototype (Sender + Receiver) that can be put in our homes for hazards detection. it works as below:<br>
1.The sender platform (TM4C123GH6PM) is connected to three sensors (Fume Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, And Magnetic Sensor).<br>

2.If sensors detect any danger (ex: fire, Door is opened, or intrusion). Data will be sent over using light and the LDR module will detect that light the receiver circuit is connected to arduino and buzzer to alert the user<br>

3.The light to the receiver platform, which can be any other board, to turn on alarms represented in a flashing Lamp, buzzer, and a LCD that displays a sentence related to the detected event (ex: “Fire is reported”).<br>

4.Bluetooth to a mobile phone with the same sentence as the LCD.<br>
